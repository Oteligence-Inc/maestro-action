# TODO: maestro-action

**Open:** 0 · **Next ID:** 1

Open bugs only. Severities reflect verified impact, not the original audit label.
A ticket is the facet line plus Where, Failure mode (the repro), and Fix. Essays belong in
`README.md`, `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md`, or a comment next to the code.

Forward-looking only: a finished item is **deleted**, not annotated (git history holds it), and a
partial fix is rewritten as a **narrowed residual**. Numbers are **stable, sparse ids other repos
cite**: never renumber, never re-use a gap. Severity lives in the section heading. The line above is
machine-maintained: run `python3 platform-overview/scripts/check-todos.py --fix-header maestro-action`
from the work root rather than editing it. **The trailing repo name is the scope argument and is
not optional:** unscoped, that command rewrites every register it finds.

    #### 1. One-line problem statement, present tense, naming the symptom

    - **Needs:** decision · **Repos:** maestro-action
    - **Where:** `functionName` in `src/...`, never `file:line`, which drifts on every edit
    - **Failure mode:** what breaks, for whom, and how it would be noticed
    - **Fix:** the concrete change, or **Decision needed:** the closed question with its options

**`Needs`** is what the item waits on, and may list several. `decision` · `approval` · `input` **block**;
`capability` · `upstream` · `vendor` queue; `queued` means no blocker was recorded. Label any
*mechanism* sentence **PROVEN** / **OBSERVED** / **REASONED**.

**Add:** take `Next ID`, then raise it. **Remove:** delete an entry only once a failure-first test of
its *canonical* scenario passes and the fix's trigger is confirmed to be produced; otherwise rewrite
it as the narrowed residual, keeping its number. Never cite a number from code or a code comment.

Cross-repo items (the required `api-url` input, the Node 24 runtime and the pin bump in the platform's
`maestro-deploy.yml` copies) live in `platform-overview/TODO.md`.
